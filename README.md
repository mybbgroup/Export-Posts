## About Export Posts

Export Posts is a plugin for [MyBB](https://mybb.com/) 1.8. It allows members to export their posts with a similar interface to the core facility to export private messages.

## Requirements

* [The PHP zip extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.zip.php), and in particular its [ZipArchive class](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.ziparchive.php). Without this class, post attachments cannot be downloaded along with posts.

## Installing

1. Download the zip archive.

2. Extract its files.

3. Copy (recursively) the files under "root" into your forum's root.

4. Install+activate the plugin via the ACP's _Plugins_ page.

5. Configure the plugin in the ACP under _Settings_ -> _Plugin Settings_ -> _Export Posts_

## Upgrading

1. Deactivate the plugin via the ACP.

2. Download, extract, and copy files as in steps one, two, and three for installing above.

3. Reactivate the plugin via the ACP.

This will maintain any settings and template changes that you've made, although if you've made template changes, you may after upgrading need to navigate in the ACP to _Templates & Style_ -> _Templates_ -> _Find Updated Templates_ to properly integrate/update this plugin's templates.
